4. Create Volume And Update Container

## What is Volume in Docker?
- Volume is a way to persist the data in the container.
- It is a way to share the data between the host and the container.

## Continues Changes in Container With Volume
- When we make changes in the container, it will not reflect on the host.
- We need to create a volume to reflect the changes on the host.


## Add Nodemon And Update Docker File
- Add nodemon to the package.json file.
- Update the Dockerfile to install nodemon.

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
  },
```

```dockerfile
# Use the official image as a parent image
FROM node:latest
RUN npm install -g nodemon
WORKDIR /app
COPY  . .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm","run","dev"]
```

## Create Volume And Update Container
- Create a volume to reflect the changes on the host.
- Update the container to use the volume.

```shell
docker build -t nodemon1 .
```

# Run The Docker Container with Volume
```shell
docker run --name nodemon1 -p 5000:5000 --rm -v C:/Users/samra/OneDrive/Documents/Docker/NodeApp:/app nodemon1
```

```shell
docker run --name nodemon1 \               # Assign a name to the container (nodemon1)
  -p 5000:5000 \                           # Map port 5000 of the host to port 5000 of the container
  --rm \                                   # Automatically remove the container once it stops
  -v C:/Users/samra/OneDrive/Documents/Docker/NodeApp:/app \  # Mount the NodeApp directory on the host to /app inside the container
  nodemon1                                 # The image name to run the container (nodemon1)
```

## Whats is use of a Compose File?
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## How To Make Compose File?
1. Create a new file in your project directory.
2. Name it as `docker-compose.yaml`.
3. Write the configuration of your services in this file.
4. Save the file.

## Write a command in file.
compose.yaml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  img:
    build: .
    container_name: basic-con
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
```

## Run the Compose File.
1. Open terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the command `docker compose up`.
3. It will build the image and run the container.
4. You can access the container on `localhost:5000`.

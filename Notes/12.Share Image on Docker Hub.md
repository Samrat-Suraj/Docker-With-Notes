## What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories, build your images and test them, store manually pushed images, and link to Docker Cloud so you can deploy images to your hosts. It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management, user and team collaboration, and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline.
